## Usage
This application is simple to use. All you need to do is type in the name of a city in the search bar and hit the search button. You need access to an internet connection in order for it to then display the current weather and the next five days' forecast. You can even select previously-searched cities from the search bar, or click on a list of major Canadian cities below the search bar. It should format nicely on screens small and large, usable by all.

## Contribute
If you wish to contribute to this application's development, here are a few ways you can do so:
-Submit bugs and feature requests

What cities should be displayed beneath the search bar for quick use? Let me know!

## Tests
There are so many cities with similar or identical names that could confuse the simple search system. When checking functionality, always be aware that the results you get may be skewed by cultural, linguistic or syntactic misunderstanding in that regard.

### Frequently Asked Questions
#### Why doesn't it show my city, town or settlement?
Perhaps the One Call API doesn't include the desired location, or maybe not under the search term you expected. Try adding a comma and an abbreviation for the name of the state, province, territory or country next to it, to clarify the search.
#### Can it show more information?
If further developed, it absolutely could. If I receive requests to expand this application, I could see adding hourly updates, a full 7 day week of forecast data, and more.
